            I work as a Credit Analyst in Sterling Bank. I have been with the Bank for over 3 years now. The bootcamp of the Tech Academy organized by my organization started today and it has been exciting. So far, I have learnt the very rudimentary of web designing and understand the basic component of HTML. I even created my first website!
